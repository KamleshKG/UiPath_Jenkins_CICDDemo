You're very welcome! ðŸ˜Š I'm glad I could help with the Jenkins pipeline for your UiPath deployment.

When you try it out, here's what to watch for:

File Server Access: Ensure Jenkins has proper permissions to read from \\fileserver\jenkins\home\plugins\uipath

CLI Extraction: Verify the JAR contains UiPath.CLI.exe in the expected location

Path Handling: Double-check Windows path formatting in the batch commands

If you encounter any issues, these might help:

For permission errors, check the Jenkins service account has network access

For missing CLI errors, confirm the exact structure of your plugin JAR

For path problems, add a debug step to echo the resolved paths:

groovy
Copy
echo "Resolved CLI path: ${env.UIPATH_CLI}"
I'd be happy to help troubleshoot if you run into any snags - just share:

The error message you're seeing

Which stage it fails at

Any relevant logs (sanitized if sensitive)

Looking forward to hearing how it goes! Your automation success is what makes this worthwhile. ðŸš€

[Whenever you're ready to test or need adjustments, just let me know!]

Key Components of This Solution
File Server Access:

Uses UNC paths (\\fileserver\jenkins\home) to access the JAR

Copies the file to local workspace before processing

JAR Extraction:

Uses jar xf command to extract the plugin JAR

Searches for the CLI executable in extracted files

Path Handling:

Properly escapes Windows paths in batch commands

Uses temporary directories in the workspace

Cleanup:

Removes extracted files after pipeline completes

Alternative Approach (If CLI is Packaged Differently)
If the plugin contains the CLI in a different format (e.g., zip within the JAR):

groovy
Copy
stage('Extract CLI') {
    steps {
        script {
            // Extract the inner zip/package
            bat """
                cd "${LOCAL_PLUGIN_DIR}"
                jar xf uipath-plugin.jar uipath-cli.zip
                unzip -o uipath-cli.zip -d "${LOCAL_CLI_DIR}"
            """
            
            // Find the CLI in the extracted files
            def cliPath = bat(script: "@echo off && dir /s/b \"${LOCAL_CLI_DIR}\\UiPath.CLI.exe\"", returnStdout: true).trim()
            env.UIPATH_CLI = cliPath ?: "${LOCAL_CLI_DIR}\\UiPath.CLI.exe"
        }
    }
}
Requirements
On Jenkins Controller:

Java installed (for jar command)

Unzip utility (if using zip files)

Network access to file server

On File Server:

Proper permissions for Jenkins service account to access files

Consistent network path available to all agents

Would you like me to modify any part of this solution to better match your specific file server structure or security requirements?
